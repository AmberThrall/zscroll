* Zscroll
** Example
The '-n' is needed when using with bar-aint-recursive:
#+begin_src sh
$ zscroll -n -b "â®• " "$(mpc current) - "
# or
$ mpc current | zscroll
#+end_src

A much zoomed in example (note that the scroll speed can be changed):

For the function I use with bar-aint-recursive see the [[https://github.com/angelic-sedition/dotfiles/blob/a251c682aa71e115ca83e75f938016e2f134ed47/aesthetics/.panel_scripts/panel#L39][corresponding section]] in my panel script. It deals with updating the scroller on state and song changes. Also see [[https://github.com/angelic-sedition/dotfiles/blob/a251c682aa71e115ca83e75f938016e2f134ed47/aesthetics/.panel_scripts/panel#L83][the section]] for scrolling xtitle output as an example.

** Why
I was using benghaem's scroller for a while. I didn't like that the arguments were all positional, the lack of a right text padding option, and the lack of an option to change the scroll speed. I just found skroll which is nicer since it has options and an actual manpage and is in the AUR. However, it doesn't have a left text option which is necessary for my bar script to work properly. Also, they are both written in c, which doesn't seem practical to me for such a simple script.

Zscroll supports the features I liked from each. It has a speed option, adds an option for right padding text, and will work on text as an argument or piped into it.

I called this zscroll because it's the last scroller I'll use.. but more importantly because I couldn't think of another name.
